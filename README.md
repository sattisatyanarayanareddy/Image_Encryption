# Image_Encryption
Image Encryption and decryption using python
We Have simple steps to Execute the code
Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide:

**Step 1:** Ensure that Python is installed on your local system. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

**Step 2:** Open a terminal or command prompt.

**Step 3:** Check the Python version by typing the following command and pressing Enter:

python --version
or for Python 3:

python3 --version

**Step 4:** Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located using the `cd` command:

cd path/to/your/directory


**Step 5:** Run the Python script using the following command:

python main.py
or for Python 3:
python3 main.py
**Make sure to replace `path/to/your/directory` with the actual path where your `main.py` file is located. This will execute the Tkinter GUI application for image encryption and decryption.**

**After Execition:**
**Initially we got one box like this**

**If you wish to decrypt the image, simply re-upload the image file and provide the same key that you used during the encryption process**
